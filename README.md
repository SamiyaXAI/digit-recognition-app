# Handwritten Digit Recognition App

This app lets users draw digits (0-9) on a canvas and predicts the digit using a trained CNN model.

## How It Works
- Model is trained on MNIST dataset using PyTorch.
- App is built using Streamlit.
- Users draw a digit and get instant predictions!

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Streamlit app:
3. ## Files
- `train_model.ipynb` - Code for training the model.
- `mnist_cnn.pth` - Saved trained model.
- `app.py` - Streamlit web app code.
